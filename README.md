Instagram Photo Downloader (Java) 
----------------------------------
*Note -No Authentication Needed

This tool allows you to download all the photos of any user on Instagram (That user must have open profile for visitors).


It has 2 main functions
---

1) Picture link scraper - scrape all picture links. This can be used to download the photos at a later stage. (In any download manager)

2) Picture Downloader - can be used after the link scraping stage (Utilizes 50 threads)

The entire fetched link list will be saved on the same work directory of the program (Format is WorkDirectory//inputUsername.txt)

Photos are saved on WorkDirectory//photoNum.jpg


---
This was coded for fun. It does not utilize any offical instagram API (I have reversed the instagram api logic myself).
