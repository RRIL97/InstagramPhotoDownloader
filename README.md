Instagram Photo Downloader (Java)

This tool allows you to download all the photos of any user on Instagram that you choose. (Those users who have open profiles for visitors)


It has 2 main functions

1) Picture link scraper - scrapes all links for the user pictures. This can be used to download the photos at a later stage.
2) Downloader - can be used after the scraping stage. (default uses 50 threads)



This was coded for fun and does not utilize any of the offical instagram API. (Atleast not that I am aware of, I reversed it myself)
