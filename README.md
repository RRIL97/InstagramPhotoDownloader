Instagram Photo Downloader (Java) |
-----------------------------------

This tool allows you to download all the photos of any user on Instagram. (That user must have open profile for visitors)


It has 2 main functions
---

1) Picture link scraper - scrape all picture links. This can be used to download the photos at a later stage. (In any download manager)

2) Downloader - can be used after the link scraping stage. (Utilizes 50 threads)
You can skip this feature if you don't want to download the pictures.

The entire fetched link list will be saved on the same work directory of the program. (Format is **inputUsername.txt)

This was coded for fun. It does not utilize any offical instagram API (I have reversed the instagram api logic myself).
